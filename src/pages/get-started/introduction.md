# Introduction

Django REST framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Python using the Django web
framework. It helps developers create RESTful APIs with ease and follows the principles of Representational State
Transfer (REST). DRF is widely used in web development to build APIs that interact with client applications, such as
single-page applications (SPAs), mobile apps, and other web services.
